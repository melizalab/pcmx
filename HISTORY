    - Started this history file.  Pcmx has been around for many
        years before this, though.
    - Got rid of the Imakefiles, replaced with custom Makefile
    - Added -help and -version command line options.
    - Added simple versioning system.
    - Cleaned up play_samples() to better handle errors from
        the Linux audio output device.
